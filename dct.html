	<p>A lot of my friends were struggling to find valid information regarding college admissions tips. They had a hard time sourcing the tips and then making sure they were reliable. I developed a site called Daily College Tip that provides students looking for college counseling with daily, free, emailed college admissions tips. Users subscribe on dailycollegetip.com and they then get tips sent straight to their inbox. Stack: Sendgrid, MailChimp<br> <br>Check out the github repo <a class="dct-gh" href="https://github.com/lindsayesterman/college-tips" target="_blank">here</a>. <br><br>The project has 51 subscribers and had currently received over 70% open rates. In Fall of 2020, I am going to be launching a more complex version to distribute to high school students.</p><br>
